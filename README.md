# Farewell Notice – CRYSTALYST

Hey folks!

First of all, **huge thanks** to everyone who tried out CRYSTALYST, or simply trusted it enough to run it on their machines. It started as a hobby project, and it’s been a fun ride.

I’ve decided to **retire the CRYSTALYST project** and shift my focus to developing a new and hopefully even better encryption algorithm. CRYSTALYST has been awesome as an experimental playground, but I’ve got some fresh ideas that deserve a clean slate and a new architecture.

So, CRYSTALYST is officially sunsetted. It won’t receive further updates or maintenance. If you’re using it, feel free to keep tinkering with it, but remember:

* **CRYSTALYST remains experimental** and hasn’t been audited.
* It’s **not suitable for production or highly sensitive data**.
* There will be **no new features, fixes, or support** from this point on.

Thanks again for the journey, and stay tuned for my next cryptographic adventure. I’m excited to explore new designs, possibly even more robust post-quantum techniques, and better performance profiles.

Wishing you all perfectly balanced entropy and zero memory leaks. See you on the other side!
