## Statistical Test Results

This implementation has been tested using official and widely recognized randomness testing suites:

- ‚úÖ NIST SP 800-22
- ‚úÖ Dieharder

**[Click here to view full test results](TEST_SUITES/OVERALL_SCORE.md)**
All tests passed with strong or perfect ratings. A few tests flagged as ‚Äúweak‚Äù due to extremely uniform results, which is acceptable.

\> Note: Tests were conducted on encrypted output of a 50MB all-zero input using CRYSTALYST with Argon2d. See `output.bin` for reproducibility.

## Dynamic S-Box generation:
- \> CRYSTALYST introduces a novel approach to Dynamic S-Box generation, ensuring each encryption operation uses a unique, unpredictable S-Box. This dynamic generation enhances security by preventing precomputed attacks and reducing the effectiveness of statistical analysis.
### How much entropy does it provide?
- \> It's providing 8.0000 shanon entropy, which is the maximum possible entropy, because always it has 256 bytes (0..255).
### How unique is it?
- \>%99.99 (Almost never generates same S-Box), its not perfect because of the nature of the algorithm, and never can generate fully unique S-Box, but it's close to it.
### How is that even possible on real time?:
- 1. **Key X Nonce combination**: Combining Key and Nonce using a secure hash function (If computed before using precomputed values), ensuring aperiodic distribution and unpredictability.
- 2. **Golden Ratio**: Irrational number properties, ensuring aperiodic distribution and unpredictability.
- 3. **Fisher-Yates Shuffle**: Randomizes the order of elements in the S-Box, ensuring each permutation is unique and unpredictable.
- 4. **Pregenerate S-Box, after swapping**: Swapping Pregenerated S-Box, this is lightweight and efficient.
- 5. **Cache Optimization**: Getting pre-generated Key X Nonce combination from cache, no computation power needed.
### Test Results:
- Tested through static key, different nonce values
- Generation **repeated over 10 million times**, **no duplicates found**

\> If same key (if you used Salt, same Salt needed as well) + nonce it will generate same S-Box, it's how it should be.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
cargo add crystalyst
```

## Quick Example

```rust
use crystalyst::{CrystalystBuilder, Config, Nonce, Utils, NonceType};

let nonce = Nonce::generate_nonce(None, NonceType::Classic);
let utils = Utils::new().wrap_all(true);
let config = Config::default();

let encrypted = CrystalystBuilder::new()
    .data(b"Hello, world!")
    .password("super_secret_password")
    .nonce(nonce)
    .config(config)
    .encrypt()
    .expect("encryption failed");

let decrypted = CrystalystBuilder::new()
    .data(&encrypted)
    .password("super_secret_password")
    .config(config)
    .decrypt()
    .expect("decryption failed");

assert_eq!(decrypted, b"Hello, world!");
```

## Key Features
- **Testing**: Local entropy/avalanche/bit balance testing modules included.
- **Recovery Key**: Generates recovery key based on your main Password and Nonce.
- **Counter Mode**: Securely manages encryption and decryption using a counter mode.
- **SIMD Support**: Processing through single instruction but multiple data. (Performance boost)
- **TPM Operations**: Securely manages cryptographic operations using Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
- **512-bit Key Support**: Supports keys of up to 512 bits for enhanced security.
- **Constant-Time Execution (Locally Verified)**: All critical operations are implemented to run in constant time, minimizing timing side-channel risks. While extensive local testing confirms stability across various inputs, third-party validation is recommended for formal assurance.
- **Salt Support**: Cryptographic salt generation using `Salt::new()` to prevent rainbow table attacks.
- **Infinite Rounds**: User-defined encryption round count.
- **Wrap-All Support**: Seamlessly wraps salt, nonce, version, etc. into final output.

- **Secure Key Derivation**: Argon2 for password hashing.
- **Dynamic S-boxes**: Based on password, nonce, or both.
- **Finite Field Arithmetic**: Galois Field operations similar to AES MixColumns and you can use AES MixColumns.
- **Dummy Data**:
  - **Input Shield:** If input is empty, generates 1 B‚Äì8 KB of random ‚Äújunk.‚Äù
  - **Output Decoys:** Appends up to 10 KB of extra random bytes post-encryption to confuse size-based analysis.
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses Rayon for multicore CPU support.
- **Zeroized Memory**: Automatic clearing of sensitive data in RAM.
- **Perfect Distribution**:
  - Exhaustive statistical tests confirms near-theoretical perfection:
    - Shannon Entropy: `8.0000`, which we reach 7.99999+ (Perfect randomness, Max, Normal: 7.99999+, Min: 7.98)
    - Bit Balance: `1.0000`, which we reach 0.999+ (Perfect bit distribution, Max, Normal: 0.99-1, Min: 0.98)
    - Avalanche Effect: `0.5000`, which we reach 0.499+ (Ideal avalanche ratio, Max, Normal: 0.5, Min: 0.49)
  - Verified over 10,000 independent test runs.
- **Memory Hard**: Algorithm is designed to be memory-hard, making it resistant to brute-force attacks even with large amounts of memory.
- **Zero Memory Leak (Verified in Local Testing)**:
  Extensive `Valgrind` testing under multiple stress scenarios (including 25x repeat encryption) shows zero **definite** or **indirect** memory leaks.
  (Note: Not yet validated by third-party audits or formal verification tools.)

### How to use TPM:
```rust
let manager = TpmModule;
let nonce = Nonce::generate_nonce(
    None,
    NonceType::Tpm(
        config.hardware,
        manager,
        manager.generate_context(config.hardware).unwrap(),
    ),
)
.unwrap();

let salt = Salt::tpm_salt(
    config.hardware,
    manager,
    &mut manager.generate_context(config.hardware).unwrap(),
)
.unwrap();

// How to enable TPM hashing (EXAMPLE):
let config = Config::default().set_hardware(Hardware::new().set_hardware_hashing(true));
```

### Custom Configuration
- üöß If you forget your configuration, you won't be able to decrypt the data. (Especially important if you changed round count, Key Length, or polynomial.)
```rust
use crystalyst::{CrystalystBuilder, Config, DeviceList, SboxTypes, IrreduciblePoly};

let config = Config::default()
    .set_thread(ThreadStrategy::Custom(4))
    .gf_poly(IrreduciblePoly::Custom(0x14d))
    .rounds(6); // 6 ~ 8 Rounds recommended
```

### Using Predefined Profiles
```rust
use crystalyst::{Config, Profile};

let config = Config::from_profile(Profile::Secure);
```

### Machine-specific Encryption
```rust
use crystalyst::{CrystalystBuilder, Config, Nonce};

let nonce = Nonce::generate_nonce(None, NonceType::Machine); // You can generate via Machine info + Rng
let password = "your_password_here".machine_rng(false); // False means no distro lock
```
